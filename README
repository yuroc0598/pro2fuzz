Progressive Fuzzing:


Overview:

1) share progress with fuzzer using shared mem, trace_bits:

init : when shm is created, add one more byte at the end, init it to 0, this is for the "c" value in testing program. (how does TP load and write to this shm? currently TP load by default, so don't load it again.)



TP write: when the value of c in testing program changes, write to the last byte of shm, (fork server will compare the value of c after each TP with the global prev_c, if it changes, proceed the fuzzing), also, write current reponse p2 to file, new_p2,

fuzzer read: every time after fuzzing, (in fuzz_common_stuff), read from shm, check if the value of c changes, if so, save the current fuzzing input to prev_p1, also read p2 from the file new_p2 and put it into Q2, increment the fuzzing Q from Q1 to Q2

commute: when c changes in TP, TP will increment the value of fixed fuzzing step, "step", (at this moment, fork server is already on, how to reset it, or just leave it and continue fuzzing the next stage?) we can keep the forking server stuff, next time TP is launched, use the prev_p1 for p1, and newly fuzzed p2 from fuzzer for p2






Hands on:

1) How is c used in fuzzer:
    - add has_new_packet()
	- fuzzer will send step value to shm every execute: when to change the value?

	- some basic logic when new packets are seen: (when interesting p1 activate them all), let the fuzzer commands, though some operation could be done either on fuzzer side or TP side. Let the fuzzer decide the step and TP just read it and do what it says:
		- fuzzer: 1) change shm, set "step" value; 2) put current p2 into Q2, p2 is the response caused by interesting p1; 3) jump out of current fuzzing loop and fuzz on Q2, still put the mutated p2 into "input" file
		- TP: 1) every time write p1 to f_p1, p2 to f_p2; 2) read from shm, change the value of step; 3) for packets before "step", use the file p1, p2 to overwrite the generated packets, for the packet right on "step", use the fuzzed "input" file.


2) when to use switch_to_Q() and proceed_fuzzing():
	- how to jump out of current fuzzing and proceed: the function common_fuzz_stuff, will return 1 if it is time to bail out, so just ask it to bail out if has_new_packet. The label it will go to is abandon_entry. So we should return 2 if new packets are seen, then in the main while loop, deal with 2, call proceed_fuzzing to change target Q.




3) Implement Q:

	- what are those vars of queue that can be directly replaced with Q, and what are those need to use addition, or complete restore.
	- I/O stuff needs to be updated, the -i input takes the PROG/in, then based on the packet to fuzz, the real input folder is PROG/in/px, and add '-p' option to AFL. So update the in_dir, out_dir. Use a global var to store the value of p, e.g., Qid. And check where do in_dir, out_dir used, update them. or use two more var to represent the raw in and out passed by -i and -o, then make in_dir = in + qid,
    - Make sure that switch_to_Q is called before add_to_Q, cz in add_to_Q, the globals are not checked, must be the globals from the right Q; also check when is the queue entry written to file in the dir "out_dir/queue", cz we need to do the same when reading the q2: It's in function pivot_inputs(), add it to the read_next_packet() when first switches to some Q;
    - the var Q_havoc_div need to be init when the struct Q is created;
    - top_rated needs to be taken care of separatedly, if we maintain multiple top_rated, then make the global one a pointer, when switch_to_Q, change the value of top_rated, but in store_Q, there is no need to change the top_rated. Check whether a pointer of top_rated would cause any problem in exisiting AFL impl.
    - do not forget to create Q1 at the beginning;




4) TP:
	- need to let TP fuzz according to the step value, e.g., if c is smaller than step, then just ask it to read from the packets written previously
	- make the name of written packet the same, "packet", distinguish them by the folder they are in.


5) back-track fuzzing
	- when to stop current fuzzing step and back track?: when the new Q, say, Q2, has finished one or two circle? or when the tracebits have not changed for a long time
	- how to do backtrack?  step value decreases by 2, save current Q, switch to lower Q,
	- rethink the value of decrease and increase of step value again, suppose at first we only have c=2, then next time c=4; or from c=2 then c=3, how to determine the change of step value: set a min(1) and max(6) value for c, then check it in has_new_packet.



Done:
1) how to obtain addr of shm in TP, during instrumentation, afl-clang-fast already does the shmat. (Check where does the binary write bitmap, after that, write c?)
  - why not use environment var?: no, env var are set before process starts and can only be seen by children
  - read SHM_EVN_VAR, in TP, use shmat again, basically, map the shm twice. 



TODO:
1) shm is mapped twice, if the afl_area_ptr can be obtained from LLVM pass to source code, this can be avoided;
2) multi q,
3) Bread-first fuzzing considering only p1 and p2
4) check AFL_DONT_OPTIMIZE, unset this env var may cause AFL_CLANG_FAST to optimize bbs and bugs cannot be found
5) in default AFL, compiler instruments each basic block, such that when one basic block executes, the bitmap is updated. It does not read values from the variables inside the TP.
6) check bg, fg command that bring up the frozen process.
